Practice app 

This app was mainly made to test myself and work with text manipulation. I am no expert, but if the code helps or gives others ideas on how to improve their own, hopefully it helps.

#Main purpose
Is to extract word count.
Is to extract every character used and return a list with the amount of letters used in frequency order.
